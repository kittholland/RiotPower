# RiotPower
Powershell module for Riot Games API

This is going to initially be a powershell wrapper for the Riot Games Rest API https://developer.riotgames.com/api/

Outside of duplicating their methods will be functions for api key management and handling Riots apikey throttling.

Eventually I'd like to have more complex logic and mapping for specific queries. If you have any questions or suggestions let me know.
